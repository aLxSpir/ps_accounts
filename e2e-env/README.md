# PS Eventbus e2e Env

## Introduction

Enabling the startup of a complete stack to perform e2e tests on `ps_accounts`.
stack consists of the following elements:

- A storefront under Flashlight (with a mock of `ps_account` and a local link to `ps_accounts`);
- A MySQL database;
- PHPMyAdmin;
- A mock of the CloudSync APIs.

For the CloudSync APIs mock, it is a NodeJS application simulating the CloudSync APIs. Requests made by `ps_accounts` to CloudSync are redirected to the mock using a reverse proxy (nginx).
When a request reaches the mock, it utilizes WebSockets to transmit the said request from `ps_accounts` to the E2E tests, allowing validation of the information coming out of `ps_accounts`.

## Troubleshooting

The end-to-end environment relies on PrestaShop Flashlight, which by default runs scripts and php with the user `www-data`. This user is mapped on the uid/gid _1000_, which might perfectly match your own Linux system user.

However, if for any reason your uid is not 1000, you might disable code mentioned with this comment : `# Notice: you might enable this if your uid is not 1000, or encounter permission issues`. One thing you will loose, is the ability to hot-reload local vendors on your host to the guest docker container. Docker compose down/up will be your friend in that very case.

If you are a MacOS user, mounting a docker won't cause any issue, as the process isolation is greater (and slower).

## Start the environment

1. Create your own configuration from the default values:

```shell
cp .env.dis .env
```

2. start docker environment:

```shell
docker compose up
```

Or in detached mode:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Or specifically only starting PrestaShop (and its dependencies) with special commands to be sure your containers and volumes will be recreacted/renewed:

```shell
docker compose up prestashop --force-recreate --renew-anon-volumes
```

## Make changes to the mock

If you need to make change to the mocks, they can be built and run locally using scripts in `package.json`.
Don't forget to rebuild your docker image for your changes to take effect immediately :

```shell
docker compose build --no-cache
```

## Usage

Once the environment is running, simply navigate to the e2e directory and run the e2e tests.
